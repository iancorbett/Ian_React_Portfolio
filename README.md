# Ian_React_Portfolio

This is a project that I have built from scratch. I needed to write all of the html code as well as all of the css code, jsx, and more. I am making this project in order to have a well made portfolio that can be viewed in the future by prospective employers. It also will serve as a convenient place to save some of my best projects. I intend to update this page throughout my time doing the bootcamp, as I complete more projects and improve my skills in web development.
